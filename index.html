                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-why-it-matters">Not Your Keys, Not Your Crypto</a>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    You should not store your coins at a custodial service unless they are insured and you're getting something out of it (ie. earning interest, more on that later)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Do Not purchase your crypto through Paypal or Robinhood</strong> (I made this mistake the first time) or other services that do not allow you to withdraw your funds.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    All of the hacks you hear about in the news are of exchanges/custodial services (and more recently, defi lending programs with smart contract bugs)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If you prefer to have your own keys, a <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.onemonth.com/hot-wallet-vs-cold-storage/#:~:text=Hot%20wallet%20refers%20to%20any,is%20connected%20to%20the%20internet.&text=Cold%20storage%20refers%20to%20any,many%20of%20the%20hot%20wallets.">cold wallet</a> is preferable.
                                    For this I recommend <a target="_blank" href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/hardware-wallets-comparison">Ledger</a> as they are pretty much the industry standard.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>
                            Double, Triple, Quadruple check the address you are sending your crypto to
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If you send your crypto to the <a target="_blank" href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/i-sent-funds-to-the-wrong-address-how-do-i-get-them-back.html">wrong address</a>, it is gone. 
                                    <strong>Transactions are irreversible</strong>. This is the nature of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain (it is a feature, not a bug). While this may be scary to some degree, it is not that hard to make sure you are sending it to the correct address.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Most wallet addresses are coin-specific (A ledger wallet, for example would have many addresses for each kind of crypto you can contain in it). As a beginner you probably won't need to worry about this, but yes, if you aren't paying attention, you can lose your money.
                                </li>

                            <br>
                            There are plenty of options out there for earning interest on your crypto. Here are the main things I look for in a platform:

                                    Lastly, if you are anxious about purchasing bitcoin, consider that you can buy a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp">stablecoin</a> and use that to earn far higher interest than you are getting on your cash in the bank or in a CD right now.
                                    I'm currently swamped working on this project right now, but I'm happy to message about it in person until I can get some info about stablecoins up on here, and I would highly recommend doing this with some of your assets as well.

                                    There are a number of ways to move fiat into crypto. Paying with credit/debit will cost you an ass-ton in fees. There are a number of exchanges that will allow you to link your bank account. While Kraken has slightly lower fees, I've found their KYC and Bank Transfer process to be a little more obnoxious.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a target="_blank" href="pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a> has lower fees than regular old Coinbase. Please use my coinbase referral link above to make an account on coinbase, then use those same credentials to login to your coinbase pro account.

                                    KYC and bank account linking on coinbase pro is very easy, funds are transferred quickly. You will have purchasing power instantly, but must wait some time (like a week) before withdrawing (for AML purposes).

                            The 4 Year Cycle<br>
                            The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-halving-4843769">Halving</a> is an important event that affects the supply of bitcoin roughly every 4 years
                            (it's actually a factor of how many blocks have been mined which is affected by hashrate and number of transactions, so the exact date can only be predicted up until we are at the event)
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <img class="img" src="./assets/images/halving chart.png">
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The 3rd halving occured on May 11, 2020. We are still just at the beginning of this market's bull cycle. The time to buy is now, before the price goes parabolic and enters bubble territory
                                    <img class="img" src="./assets/images/psych-market-cycle.jpg">

                                <li>
                                    Because Bitcoin is so young and has not gone fully mainstream, many people do not understand the significance of the halving.
                                    Until widespread adoption, it follows a bubble --> consolidation --> halving --> bubble market structure as the mainstream chooses to pop its head in now and then to see how things are going

                                    Buy after the market goes through it's bear cycle and reaches a relative bottom. Then sell a couple years after the halving during the next peak. It's that simple.

                                    A lot of people who are risk averse look at the volatility of the crypto market and say it is a reason they will stay out, this is short-sighted. Crypto is growing rapidly.

                                    Bitcoin should be considered a long-term investment. The macro view has proven to be relatively predictable based on the halving supply shock, and ever-increasing mainstream adoption.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Invest money that you will not need access to for a 1/2/3 years (depending on where you buy in the cycle). Then ignore the short-term pumps/dumps. They ultimately don't matter if you're goal is to ride the market cycle, hopping on and off at appropriate times.

                                <li>
                                    As mainstream adoption occurs, <a target="_blank" href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-volatility-vs-other-assets/">bitcoin volatility</a> is <a target="_blank" href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-volatility/">ever-decreasing</a> as the markets become more effecient.

                                    Volatility works both ways. While people freak out when there is a 30% correction, no one is complaining when it goes up $1k or more in a day. This volatility is what has allowed it to grow so rapidly.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The best way to buy bitcoin to mitigate the affects of volatility is to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar cost average</a> into your position over time. That means buying the dips.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Since we are already in the early stages of the bull-run in this cycle, I would recommend dropping a large portion of your intdended investment on the next big dip down to the 20 week moving average, and then making small allocations at subsequent dips, up until we begin to go parabolic.
